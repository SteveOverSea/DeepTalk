# DeepTalk

## Idea

The idea of this project is to provide understanding for people we all don't know and to display the beautiful variety of humanity.

## Implementation

To make this vision feasible within a small web-project, there will be a time-limited one-to-one chat with a stranger, where afterwards the chat-history will be published.

There will be rooms for different languages, the possibility to stay connected after the chat (so that you can share contact details without having them published), you can only rate random chat-histories and sort the rating after time and language.

## Last Update

Refactored the code for the chat socket server side to be more flexible.

## Current State

There is a general waiting room established, which asks the user to enter a chatroom if two clients are available.

The chatroom is written, can be left and is aborted after the timer finishes.

### Technology

- Node.js
- Socket.io
- JavaScript (later Angular)
